## The problem with basic React

React is all about **View** and nothing about **Model** and **Controller** 

### React Data management

- React is purposefully designed to allow developers to make their own data management decisions.

- Most React Developers don't put much thought into these decisions.

### Separation of concerns

This is the main idea behind most React Ecosystem tools.

### Meet the React Ecosystem

- React Redux - State Management - using flux architecture

- Redux Thunk - Side Effect Management (network requests, etc)

- Reselect -  Abstract away the state's structure

- Styled Components - Abstract away the state's structure
